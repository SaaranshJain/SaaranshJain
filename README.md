# About myself
I am Saaransh Jain, a sophomore student at BITS Pilani, Pilani Campus. I am pursuing a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Enginnering. I am passionate about programming, math, logic and exploring science topics from the eyes of a computer scientist. I specialise in the fields of Machine Learning and Embedded Systems. My past experience includes full stack web development, game development and competitive programming. I am also an artistic person by nature, I love to meld the fields of art and computer science in the form of computer graphics, shaders and simulations. I also dabble in digital art and 3D modelling. I look forward to learning more about low level development and I wish to contribute to open source projects someday, possibly in the field of GPU programming, low level systems and embedded systems.
